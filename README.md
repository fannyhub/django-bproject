django-bproject part 1
===============

Setup and run!
--------------

So we want to build a Django-powered application. Before starting we need some
tools, assure the following things are installed on your pc:
  * pip (it makes life easier)
  * Django
  * Python
  * virtualenv
  * PostgreSQL
  * psycopg2 (PostgreSQL database adapter for Python)

If you don't have Python installed, do that first. Most of Linux distros come
out today with pre-installed Python, if you are on Windows download the .exe (2.7
version) and do the rest of the job.

Now we should install pip; pip is a tool for installing easily Python packages, if
you run Linux you can probably install it from your package manager, if you're
running something else you should read this https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html

Now that we have pip installed we can do the rest of the job easily, let's go ahead!

Fire your console and type:
`pip install virtualenv`

virtualenv creates a virtual environment where we can mess around without caring to break something (if
everything is done correctly, of course!)

First let's create a folder for our project, let's call it django-bproject (it does not matter if we create it from the command prompt or 'manually'). Now let's initialize the django-project typing in the command line (if you haven't updated your path, you should do it from the Scripts level and the folder is going to be created in the Scripts folder) 
`django-admin.py startproject bproject django-bproject`
the last two arguments are respectively the name of the folder where will live the "core" structure
of our project and the folder where we want to initialize the django project. If you don't have a folder
omit the last argument, in this case django-admin.py script will create a new one.

Good job! Now the folder django-bproject should look like:

django-bproject/
               |
               |
               manage.py
               bproject/
                       |
                       |
		       __init__.py
		       settings.py
		       urls.py
		       wsgi.py



Let's now install a virtualenv inside our folder, type `virtualenv path/to/your/django-bproject` where of course
you should write your own path to the folder created some minutes ago instead of path/......

We can now work in the virtualenv, to try it enter the folder django-bproject and type `. bin/activate`
